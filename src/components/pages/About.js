            <p>
            My Name? Luke Spang. My goal? To show you projects that I am most passionate and proud of. My background is in health care as a registered nurse. After extensive education and hard work, I am proud to say that I am now a full stack computer programmer. In my free time I am a huge sports fan. Being from Pennsylvania, I grew up loving everything Philly. I have recently relocated to Raleigh, North Carolina, so my fiancee and I enjoy exploring new areas and trying new food! I also love the beach and the ocean. If it were up to me, I would be coding in a beach chair right now.
